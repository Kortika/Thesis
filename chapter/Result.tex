\chapter{Results}%
\label{chap:Results}

In this chapter, the results gathered from our evaluation of the dynamic window against 
the tumbling window will be discussed by the order of the workloads. The workload 
evaluations are run multiple times for consistency of results. We will first 
discuss the workload for latency measurement, followed by periodic workload and 
finally the completeness measurement. For each workload results, we elaborate 
and discuss in details the shortcomings of the evaluation methods and the 
possible outlier situations for which the evaluation result would not agree with.



\section{Workload for latency measurement}%
\label{sec:Workload for latency measurement}

This workload is run with a constant low stream rate to ensure that 
the RMLStreamer is not overloaded for a more accurate latency measurement. We also measured 
CPU, throughput, and relative memory usage to determine the improvement brought by Dynamic window
in an ideal streaming environment.

For latency, Tumbling window has a median value of 1915ms, with latency ranging from 1081ms to 2624ms. 
This is as expected since the window is measured using the \emph{average} latency of all records used 
in the joined result at every \emph{trigger} event, which is fired every 2 seconds (the size of tumbling window).
In contrast, Dynamic window has sub second latency with median 57ms and ranging from 39ms to 120ms. Clearly, 
our improvement to fire the \emph{trigger} event whenever a new record arrives inside the subwindow, allows 
Dynamic window to achieve sub second latency. 

For this workload's throughput measurement, the warm up time of the JVM of around the first 10 minutes of the run, 
is removed. 
Just like latency, the throughput difference between the two windows is also significant. Dynamic window has a 
steady throughput of around 4280 records per second whereas Tumbling window fluctuates around 
3180 and 3240 records per second before stabilizing at 3205 records per second. This is expected as Dynamic 
window eventually stabilizes to a window size processing more records than Tumbling window. This is 
due to adjustment of window sizes at the subwindow level allowing Dynamic window to wait for more records 
with infrequent \emph{key} attribute in the stream before evicting the subwindow. In contrast, Tumbling window 
always evicts the content of the window after 2 seconds, even if it means that there might be more 
eligible records to be joined with the records in the soon to be evicted window.
