The Semantic Web extends the existing \emph{web of documents} with the ability 
to \emph{link} different documents and \emph{embed knowledge} in the document
to transform it into a \emph{web of data}. It is perceived by Tim Beners-Lee in 
2001\cite{bernerslee2001semantic} to be integrated into the existing architecture 
of World Wide Web. Embedding \emph{knowledge} into documents enables machines to
interpret the \emph{meaning} of the document and interoperate with each other on 
a more complex level. This results in \emph{knowledge graphs}. 

The Semantic Web stack enables the development of a \emph{web of data} using 
the core technologies shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sem_web_stack}. 
However, this is provided that the data is represented in the 
Resource Description Framework (RDF) model~\cite{rdf_concepts}. 
Existing data on the web in non-RDF format must, therefore, be transformed 
into RDF to enable transition to a \emph{web of data}. This work 
focuses on transforming non-RDF to RDF data, thus the RDF data model will be elaborated on
in detail. 



\section{Resource Definition Framework}
The Resource Definition Framework (RDF) \cite{rdf_concepts} is a framework for representing data on the Web.
It portrays the data as a directed graph with the resources as nodes in the graph and the
edges as the relationship between the different resources.
Figure~\ref{fig:rdf_triple_ex} shows an example of an RDF triple statement describing
the information “John has an apple”.
The triple statement consists of the subject \textit{John}, the predicate \textit{has}
and the object \textit{apple}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance={30mm}, main/.style = {draw, circle}]

        \node[main] (subject) {John};
        \node[main] (object) [right of=subject] {apple};

        \draw[->, thick] (subject) -- node[midway, above, sloped] {has} (object);

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{An RDF triple representing the information “John has an apple”.}

    \label{fig:rdf_triple_ex}
\end{figure}


By composing these simple triple statements into a set of RDF triples, an RDF graph is created.
In Figure~\ref{fig:rdf_graph_ex}, 4 triple statements are composed together to form a
simple RDF graph describing \textit{John} and \textit{Mary} having the same \textit{apple}.
In contrast to the 
simplicity of figures, there are advantages to
representing knowledge in RDF graphs. Data representation in a graph model allows machines to follow the
\textit{links} between the resources, and discover more unknown
data in linked knowledge graphs. Following links is possible due to the nodes in
the triples being classified as one of the 3 different term types.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance={45mm}, main/.style = {draw, circle}, font=\small]

\node[main] (subject) {John};
\node[main] (subject_2) [below of=subject] {Mary};
\node[main] (object) [right of=subject] {apple};
\node[main] (apple_object_colour) [above right of=object] {red};
\node[main] (apple_object_ripe) [below right of=object, text width=15mm] {Malus domestica};
\node [cloud, draw,cloud puffs=10,cloud puff arc=120, aspect=2, inner ysep=1em]
(colour_kg) [below right of=apple_object_colour] {colours KG};

\draw[->, thick] (subject) -- node[midway, above, sloped] {has} (object);
\draw[->, thick] (subject_2) -- node[midway, above, sloped] {has} (object);
\draw[->, thick] (apple_object_colour) -- (colour_kg);
\draw[->, thick] (object) -- node[midway, above, sloped] {has colour} (apple_object_colour);
\draw[->, thick] (object) -- node[midway, above, sloped] {scientific name} (apple_object_ripe);
\end{tikzpicture}

\subsection{Term types}
Resources are classified into 3 different term types: IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier),
literals and blank nodes. An \textit{IRI} is a unique string identifier in the global scope to
represent a resource. It is usually in the form of a web address, however, it can
also be in other forms as long as it conforms to the syntax defined in
RFC 3987~\footnote{RFC 3987: \url{https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt}}.
An IRI can represent a relationship, a concept or an object. Therefore, it could be
used in the \textit{subject}, the \textit{predicate} and the \textit{object} components of
an RDF triple.

The \textit{literal} term type is used to represent values such as strings, numbers, boolean, and dates.
Each literal can have a datatype IRI to specify the type of the data it represents. Moreover, the
language in which the data is written, could also be explicitly stated with
a language tag. However, a literal can only have either a datatype or a language tag. 

Lastly, we have the term type \textit{blank node}. Blank nodes identify resources
in the local scope (i.e. to a local file or an RDF store).
Blank nodes are only applicable as the \textit{subject}
and the \textit{object} components of an RDF triple, since they are used to
identify resources in nodes.


\section{RDF serialization formats}

The aforementioned term types are defined in the abstract RDF model and 
require a concrete serialization to store and process RDF data. 
Several serialization formats have been developed alongside RDF specifications to represent RDF
knowledge graphs.
These formats usually have trade-offs for simplicity of parsing against 
human readability. The following sections will describe some widely used formats in detail: 
RDF/XML, JSON-LD, N-Triples and N-Quads, and Turtle. 


\subsection{RDF/XML}
The earliest of the serialization formats is RDF/XML\footnote{RDF/XML: \url{https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/}}. 
It was developed during the early days of RDF when parsers, serializers and storage systems 
for XML were widely used. 
RDF/XML can be quite verbose and difficult for humans to read and understand, 
due to the mixture of a tree-structure document with a triple-based graph. 
Moreover, XML is not suited to serialize unbounded RDF data.



\subsection{N-Triples and N-Quads}
N-Triples\cite{N-Triples} is a subset of Turtle which could also be used 
to represent RDF data. In comparison to the aforementioned two formats, N-Triples is trivial to parse. 
It represents the RDF statements consisting of \emph{subject, predicate} and \emph{object} line by line. 
Each line consists of a \emph{subject, predicate, object} and a full stop indicating the termination of 
an RDF statement. N-Quads is a superset of N-Triples by adding a fourth column to denote the \emph{graph IRI}.
\emph{Graph IRIs} are used to group RDF statements into multiple graphs and associate them with an IRI.  

N-Triples and N-Quards are great for streaming RDF as they 
represent RDF statements line by line. However, without the usage of \emph{prefixes}, it is verbose and takes more 
bandwidth compared to Turtle format; which we will elaborate in detail in the following section.


\subsection{JSON-LD}
JSON-LD\cite{JSON-LD} was developed as 
the modern Linked Data format to represent RDF data in general. 
It provides a way to continue using existing 
infrastructures using JSON and upgrade from JSON to JSON-LD to utilize the power of semantic knowledge graphs. 
Although the flexibility of extending existing infrastructures to support Linked Data usage 
is favourable, it has one major drawback: a high performance cost for parsing due to 
the verbosity of the format\footnote{Performance of parsing JSON-LD: \url{http://manu.sporny.org/2016/json-ld-context-caching/}}.


\subsection{Turtle syntax}
\label{sec:turtle_syntax}
Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language)~\cite{turtle_syntax}
is the most important serialization of RDF data in this work.
 A simple triple statement is a sequence of
\textit{subject, predicate, object} terms, ending in a '.'.
To reduce the repetition of writing the same subject and predicate combination with
different objects, Turtle allows the use of ',' to separate the different objects.
Additionally, one could also use ';' to separate the different predicates and objects sharing the
same subject. 


\begin{lstlisting}[label={lst:same_subject}, 
    caption={Usage of ';' where triples share the same subject.}]
<http://example.org/apple>  ex:hasColor "red";
                            ex:scientificName "Malus domestica".
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[label={lst:different_object}, 
    caption={Usage of ',' where triples differs only in the objects.}]
<http://example.org/apple>  ex:scientificName "Malus pumila", 
                                              "Malus domestica".
\end{lstlisting}


IRIs are written between angle brackets like \lstinline{<http://example.org/#John>}.
Since blank nodes are locally scoped version of IRIs, the same syntax to write IRIs is also used.
Turtle allows us to define \textit{prefixes} at the head of the Turtle document.
Users could then use prefixes, to write RDF triples in a more compact form. For example,
\lstinline{<http://example.org/#John>} could be shortened to
\lstinline{<#John>} using the relative \textit{@base} path or written with the prefix \emph{ex:} as 
\lstinline{ex:John}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Prefixes in Turtle syntax.}, float]
    @base <http://example.org/> . # default base IRI
    @prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
    @prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
    @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
    @prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
    @prefix rel: <http://www.perceive.net/schemas/relationship/> . 
    ... 
\end{lstlisting}

A literal is written between double quotes and has by
default the \emph{xsd:string} datatype. 
One could also \textit{cast} the literal value to a specific datatype 
by appending '\textasciicircum{} \textasciicircum{} $[$IRI of the datatype$]$'. For example, 
"12" is cast to an integer in \lstinline{"12"^^xsd:integer}.
The language of the literal value 
can also be specified using \lstinline{@} similarly to datatype casting.
