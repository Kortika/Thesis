abstract = {Traditional databases store sets of relatively static records with no pre-defined notion of time, unless timestamp attributes are explicitly added. While this model adequately represents commercial catalogues or repositories of personal information, many current and emerging applications require support for on-line analysis of rapidly changing data streams. Limitations of traditional DBMSs in supporting streaming applications have been recognized, prompting research to augment existing technologies and build new systems to manage streaming data. The purpose of this paper is to review recent work in data stream management systems, with an emphasis on application requirements, data models, continuous query languages, and query evaluation.},

The techniques of machine learning have been successfully employed in assorted applications including medical diagnosis. By developing classifier system, machine learning algorithm may immensely help to solve the health-related issues which can assist the physicians to predict and diagnose diseases at an early stage. We can ameliorate the speed, performance, reliability, and accuracy of diagnosing on the current system for a specific disease by using the machine learning classification algorithms. This paper mainly targets the review of diabetes disease detection using the techniques of machine learning. Further, PIMA Indian Diabetic dataset is employed in machine learning techniques like artificial neural networks, decision tree, random forest, na{\"i}ve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and logistic regression and discussed the results with their pros and cons.},

abstract = {Many "big data" applications must act on data in real time. Running these applications at ever-larger scales requires parallel platforms that automatically handle faults and stragglers. Unfortunately, current distributed stream processing models provide fault recovery in an expensive manner, requiring hot replication or long recovery times, and do not handle stragglers. We propose a new processing model, discretized streams (D-Streams), that overcomes these challenges. D-Streams enable a parallel recovery mechanism that improves efficiency over traditional replication and backup schemes, and tolerates stragglers. We show that they support a rich set of operators while attaining high per-node throughput similar to single-node systems, linear scaling to 100 nodes, sub-second latency, and sub-second fault recovery. Finally, D-Streams can easily be composed with batch and interactive query models like MapReduce, enabling rich applications that combine these modes. We implement D-Streams in a system called Spark Streaming.},

  abstract  = {RDF aims at being the universal abstract data model for structured data on the Web. While there is effort to convert data in RDF, the vast majority of data available on the Web does not conform to RDF. Indeed, exposing data in RDF, either natively or through wrappers, can be very costly. Furthermore, in the emerging Web of Things, resource constraints of devices prevent from processing RDF graphs. Hence one cannot expect that all the data on the Web be available as RDF anytime soon. Several tools can generate RDF from non-RDF data, and transformation or mapping languages have been designed to offer more flexible solutions (GRDDL, XSPARQL, R2RML, RML, CSVW, etc.). In this paper, we introduce a new language, SPARQL-Generate, that generates RDF from: (i) a RDF Dataset, and (ii) a set of documents in arbitrary formats. As SPARQL-Generate is designed as an extension of SPARQL 1.1, it can provably: (i) be implemented on top on any existing SPARQL engine, and (ii) leverage the SPARQL extension mechanism to deal with an open set of formats. Furthermore, we show evidence that (iii) it can be easily learned by knowledge engineers that know SPARQL 1.1, and (iv) our first naive open source implementation performs better than the reference implementation of RML for big transformations.},
