\section{IMPLEMENTATION}%
\label{sec:Implementation}

The dynamic window is implemented for RMLStreamer 
to extend its capabilities to do simple stream processing by 
joining multiple streams.  Furthermore, we extended RML
with new ontologies to allow the configuration of the window. 

\subsection{RML ontology extension}
We extended RML to support configuration of window when
joining the \emph{reference object map} with its \emph{parent triples map}. 
Currently, it only supports the rudimentary 
configuration of the type of join to be applied.

\subsection{Dynamic window}
The dynamic window is implemented using Apache Flink's 
\emph{KeyedCoProcessFunction} API with the state management 
done using Flink's \emph{ListStates}.
