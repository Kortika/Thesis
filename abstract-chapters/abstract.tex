\begin{abstract}

Current state-of-the-art approaches mapping non-RDF to RDF data in 
a streaming environment focus more on the efficiency of the 
mapping process with minimal support for multi-stream processing. 
The existing approaches for supporting simple multi-stream 
processing operators in mapping engines are very limited or apply fixed window size.

Therefore, we implemented a dynamic window mechanism in RMLStreamer, which 
adapts its size according to the changing stream characteristics with
negligible memory overhead, low latency, and high throughput. We evaluated the dynamic window
under different workload with varying stream velocity. The results 
show that it achieves latency in the millisecond range, with higher 
throughput than fixed size windows in all workload situations. \\
