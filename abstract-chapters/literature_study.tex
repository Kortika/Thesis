\section{RELATED WORKS} 
\label{sec:RELATED WORKS} 
There exists state-of-the-arts approaches to map non-RDF data 
to RDF data in a streaming environment. These approaches 
implement diferent strategies when it comes to applying 
multi-stream processing. Furthermore, we will also outline
the existing works on windowing to handle changing characteristics 
of the input data stream. 

\subsection{Mapping implementations}
\subsubsection{SPARQL-Generate} 
SPARQL-Generate~\cite{sparql_generate} 
is based on an extension of SPARQL 1.1 query language, to leverage 
its expressiveness and extensibility. 
It can be implemented on top 
of any existing SPARQL query engine. 
M. Lefran\c{c}ois~\cite{sparql_generate} clarified that when joining
records from two different streams, SPARQL-Generate will fully consume the records 
from the "parent" stream and index it internally in memory first, before 
iteratively consuming the "child" stream for joining. 

\subsubsection{TripleWave} 
TriplWave~\cite{triple_wave}  is based on an extension of 
R2RML to consume heterogeneous data for publication of RDF data. 
Therefore, it only focuses on the mapping of non-RDF data stream to RDF data stream. 
Although it supports simple \emph{join} operator, it does not have a 
dynamic window to handle changing characterisitcs of a data stream.

\subsubsection{RDFGen}
RDF-Gen~\cite{rdf_gen} is based on its own custom syntax 
similar to a combination SPARQL and Turtle syntax. It processes the input 
individually therefore it employs windowing to perform multi stream operator. 
However, since the implementation is closed source, we could not confirm if 
the window is fixed size or dynamic. 

\subsubsection{RMLStreamer}
RMLStreamer~\cite{rml_streamer}
was developed to parallelize the ingestion and mapping process of RDF data generation pipeline. 
It is based on the work of RMLMapper~\cite{rml}, an RDF mapping engine consuming bounded data and mapping them to RDF data with the use of RML. Hence, RMLStreamer can also 
process heterogeneous data and generate RDF data. It does not support 
multi stream operator at this moment, however, the ease of scalability by RMLStreamer
is desirable as a stream mapping engine. 


\subsection{Windows}
Several studies have been conducted to 
improve the join algorithms in windows~\cite{vctw_join, join_tracking, grubjoin, approximate_window_sem, approx_window}. 
The approaches in ~\cite{grubjoin, approximate_window_sem, approx_window} are based 
on dropping some of the records to be joined through \emph{load shedding} if the 
records failed to meet a threshold. These threshold calculation requries 
memory overhead for storing statistical model per window or 
assumption of the stream being in-order for them to work
~\cite{grubjoin, approximate_window_sem, approx_window}.

On the other hand, VC-TWJoin~\cite{vctw_join} considers only the velocity of the 
stream to adjust the window sizes. 
However, the approach is unstable when the data stream has periodic bursts of data.
It either increases or decreases the size of the window when themetric triggers 
the threshold of the algorithm. In the worst-case scenario it 
can lead to cyclic increase and 
decrease of window sizes if the metric borders around the threshold with every 
update of the metric.
